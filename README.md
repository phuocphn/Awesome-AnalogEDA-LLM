# Awesome-AnalogEDA-LLM

A collection of AWESOME things about **Large Language Models (LLMs) for Analog Design Automation**.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in Digital-EDA tasks. However, their integration with Analog-EDA, which are prevalent in many real-world applications, remains relatively unexplored. This repository aims to bridge that gap by providing a curated list of research papers that explore the intersection of AnalogEDA with LLMs.
